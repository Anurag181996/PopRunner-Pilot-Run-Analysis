## Project Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of **PopRunner's pilot marketing campaigns** (website pop-ups with discount codes vs. promotional emails). Using SQL and R, the analysis measures campaign reach, customer engagement, and sales impact to recommend strategies for improving online advertising effectiveness.

## Objectives
- Determine if PopRunner effectively reached its intended audience.  
- Assess consumer responsiveness to pop-up vs. email campaigns.  
- Identify which campaign generated more conversions and revenue.  

## Data Description
The dataset included **9,032 consumers** with the following tables:
- **Consumer**: demographic info (age, gender, loyalty status).  
- **Email**: records of email interactions (opened/not opened).  
- **Pop-up**: consumer response to discount pop-ups and coupon usage.  
- **Purchase**: total purchase amount per consumer.  

## Key Findings
- **Reachability**: Pop-ups reached ~50% of users, while emails reached only 8%.  
- **Effectiveness**: Average spend for users opening emails ($240.8) was **82% higher** than those engaging with pop-ups ($131.7).  
- **Sales Impact**: Both campaigns influenced sales, but email campaigns had stronger purchase behavior.  

## Tech Stack
